**jfvm** is a powerful CLI tool that helps you manage multiple versions of the [JFrog CLI](https://jfrog.com/getcli/) on your system. It supports auto-installation, version switching, project-specific defaults, local binary linking, aliasing, parallel version comparison, performance benchmarking, and usage analytics ‚Äî all inspired by tools like `nvm`, `sdkman`, and `volta`.

## üöÄ Why jfvm?

Managing different versions of the JFrog CLI across multiple projects and environments can be challenging. `jfvm` simplifies this by:

- Installing any released version of the `jf` binary
- Automatically fetching and using the latest version with `jfvm use latest`
- Allowing you to link locally built versions
- Automatically switching versions based on a `.jfrog-version` file
- Letting you define named aliases (e.g., `prod`, `dev`)
- Providing a smooth `jf` shim for command redirection
- Parallel command comparison between versions with diff visualization
- Performance benchmarking across multiple versions
- Usage history tracking and analytics

No more symlink hacking or hardcoded paths.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Via Homebrew (with tap):
```bash
brew tap jfrog/jfrog-cli-vm
brew install jfvm
```

### Via one-liner:
```bash
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfrog/homebrew-jfrog-cli-vm/main/Formula/jfvm.rb
```

### Or Build From Source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli-vm.git
cd jfrog-cli-vm
make install
```

**Note**: Use `make build` instead of `go build` to ensure the executable is named `jfvm` (not `jfrog-cli-vm`).

## üì¶ Commands

### Core Version Management

#### `jfvm install <version>`
Installs the specified version of JFrog CLI (`jf`) from JFrog's public release server.
```bash
jfvm install 2.74.0
```

#### `jfvm use <version or alias>`
Activates the given version or alias. If `.jfrog-version` exists in the current directory, that will be used if no argument is passed. Use `latest` to automatically fetch and activate the most recent JFrog CLI version (downloads if not already installed). Automatically sets up PATH priority so jfvm-managed `jf` takes precedence over system-installed versions.
```bash
jfvm use 2.74.0
jfvm use latest
jfvm use prod
```

#### `jfvm list`
Shows all installed versions and the currently active one.
```bash
jfvm list
```

#### `jfvm remove <version>`
Removes a specific version of `jf`.
```bash
jfvm remove 2.72.1
```

#### `jfvm clear`
Removes **all** installed versions.
```bash
jfvm clear
```

#### `jfvm alias <n> <version>`
Defines an alias for a specific version.
```bash
jfvm alias dev 2.74.0
```

#### `jfvm link --from <path> --name <n>`
Links a **locally built `jf` binary** to be used via `jfvm`.
```bash
jfvm link --from /Users/Jfrog/go/bin/jf --name local-dev
jfvm use local-dev
```

#### `jfvm health-check`
Performs comprehensive health check of jfvm installation with various options.
```bash
# Basic health check
jfvm health-check

# Detailed health check with verbose output
jfvm health-check --verbose

# Health check with automatic fixes
jfvm health-check --fix

# Include performance and security checks
jfvm health-check --performance --security

# All options combined
jfvm health-check --verbose --fix --performance --security
```



### Advanced Features

#### `jfvm compare <version1> <version2> -- <command>`
Compare JFrog CLI command output between two versions in parallel with git-like diff visualization.

```bash
# Compare version output
jfvm compare 2.74.0 2.73.0 -- --version

# Compare command outputs with side-by-side diff
jfvm compare prod dev -- rt ping

# Show unified diff format
jfvm compare 2.74.0 2.73.0 -- config show --unified

# Disable colored output and timing
jfvm compare old new -- rt search "*.jar" --no-color --timing=false
```

**Features:**
- Parallel execution for faster results
- Side-by-side and unified diff formats
- Colored output highlighting differences
- Execution timing comparison
- Exit code and error output comparison

#### `jfvm benchmark <versions> -- <command>`
Run performance benchmarks across multiple JFrog CLI versions with detailed statistics.

```bash
# Benchmark across multiple versions
jfvm benchmark 2.74.0,2.73.0,2.72.0 -- --version

# Custom iterations and detailed output
jfvm benchmark prod,dev,latest -- rt ping --iterations 10 --detailed

# Export results as JSON or CSV

- Statistical analysis (min, max, average, success rate)
- Multiple output formats (table, JSON, CSV)
- Parallel execution across versions
- Detailed execution logs
- Performance ranking and speed comparisons

#### `jfvm history`
Track and analyze version usage patterns with comprehensive statistics.

```bash
# Show recent usage history
jfvm history

# Show detailed statistics
jfvm history --stats

# Filter by specific version
jfvm history --version 2.74.0

# Limit number of entries
jfvm history --limit 20

# Export as JSON
jfvm history --format json

# Clear history (cannot be undone)
jfvm history --clear

# Reexecute a specific history entry by ID
jfvm history '!2'  # Reexecute history entry with ID 2
jfvm history '!5'  # Reexecute history entry with ID 5
```

**Features:**
- Automatic usage tracking through the shim
- Command execution timing
- Most used versions and commands
- Usage trends and timeline analysis
- Configurable history limits
- **History replay**: Reexecute any previous command using `!{id}` syntax

## üìÅ Project-specific Version

Add a `.jfrog-version` file to your repo:
```bash
echo "2.74.0" > .jfrog-version
```
Then run:
```bash
jfvm use
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Shell Integration & Priority Management
jfvm automatically configures your shell to ensure jfvm-managed `jf` binaries have **highest priority** over system-installed versions. When you run `jfvm use <version>`, it:

1. **Creates a shim** at `~/.jfvm/shim/jf` that redirects to the active version
2. **Updates your PATH** to prioritize the jfvm shim directory (prepends to PATH)
3. **Adds a shell function** for enhanced priority handling (similar to nvm)
4. **Verifies priority** to ensure jfvm-managed versions take precedence over Homebrew or system-installed jf

The configuration is automatically added to your shell profile (`.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, etc.):
```bash
# jfvm PATH configuration - ensures jfvm-managed jf takes highest priority
export PATH="$HOME/.jfvm/shim:$PATH"

# jfvm shell function for enhanced priority (similar to nvm approach)
jf() {
    # Check if jfvm shim exists and is executable
    if [ -x "$HOME/.jfvm/shim/jf" ]; then
        # Execute jfvm-managed jf with highest priority
        "$HOME/.jfvm/shim/jf" "$@"
    else
        # Fallback to system jf if jfvm shim not available
        command jf "$@"
    fi
}
```



### Debug Mode
Set `JFVM_DEBUG=1` to see detailed shim execution information:
```bash
export JFVM_DEBUG=1
# Will show which version is being executed
jf --version
```

### Troubleshooting PATH Issues

If `jf` is still using the system version instead of jfvm-managed version:

1. **Run the health check command:**
   ```bash
   jfvm health-check --fix
   # This will verify all aspects of jfvm setup and attempt to fix issues
   ```

2. **Check which jf is being used:**
   ```bash
   which jf
   # Should show: /Users/username/.jfvm/shim/jf
   ```

3. **Verify PATH order:**
   ```bash
   echo $PATH
   # ~/.jfvm/shim should appear before /usr/local/bin or /opt/homebrew/bin
   ```

4. **Re-run use command:**
   ```bash
   jfvm use <version>
   source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
   ```

5. **Manual PATH fix:**
   ```bash
   # Add this to your shell profile
   export PATH="$HOME/.jfvm/shim:$PATH"
   ```

6. **Check for shell function conflicts:**
   ```bash
   type jf
   # Should show the jfvm shell function, not a system binary
```
