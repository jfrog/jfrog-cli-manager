**jfvm** is a powerful CLI tool that helps you manage multiple versions of the [JFrog CLI](https://jfrog.com/getcli/) on your system. It supports auto-installation, version switching, project-specific defaults, local binary linking, aliasing, parallel version comparison, performance benchmarking, and usage analytics ‚Äî all inspired by tools like `nvm`, `sdkman`, and `volta`.

## üöÄ Why jfvm?

Managing different versions of the JFrog CLI across multiple projects and environments can be challenging. `jfvm` simplifies this by:

- Installing any released version of the `jf` binary
- Allowing you to link locally built versions
- Automatically switching versions based on a `.jfrog-version` file
- Letting you define named aliases (e.g., `prod`, `dev`)
- Providing a smooth `jf` shim for command redirection
- Parallel command comparison between versions with diff visualization
- Performance benchmarking across multiple versions
- Usage history tracking and analytics

No more symlink hacking or hardcoded paths.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Via Homebrew (with tap):
```bash
brew tap jfrog/jfrog-cli-vm
brew install jfvm
```

### Via one-liner:
```bash
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfrog/homebrew-jfrog-cli-vm/main/Formula/jfvm.rb
```

### Or Build From Source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli-vm.git
cd jfrog-cli-vm
make install
```

**Note**: Use `make build` instead of `go build` to ensure the executable is named `jfvm` (not `jfrog-cli-vm`).

---

## üì¶ Commands

### Core Version Management

#### `jfvm install <version>`
Installs the specified version of JFrog CLI (`jf`) from JFrog's public release server.
```bash
jfvm install 2.74.0
```

#### `jfvm use <version or alias>`
Activates the given version or alias. If `.jfrog-version` exists in the current directory, that will be used if no argument is passed.
```bash
jfvm use 2.74.0
jfvm use prod
```

#### `jfvm list`
Shows all installed versions and the currently active one.
```bash
jfvm list
```

#### `jfvm remove <version>`
Removes a specific version of `jf`.
```bash
jfvm remove 2.72.1
```

#### `jfvm clear`
Removes **all** installed versions.
```bash
jfvm clear
```

#### `jfvm alias <n> <version>`
Defines an alias for a specific version.
```bash
jfvm alias dev 2.74.0
```

#### `jfvm link --from <path> --name <n>`
Links a **locally built `jf` binary** to be used via `jfvm`.
```bash
jfvm link --from /Users/Jfrog/go/bin/jf --name local-dev
jfvm use local-dev
```

### Advanced Features

#### `jfvm compare <version1> <version2> -- <command>`
Compare JFrog CLI command output between two versions in parallel with git-like diff visualization.

```bash
# Compare version output
jfvm compare 2.74.0 2.73.0 -- --version

# Compare command outputs with side-by-side diff
jfvm compare prod dev -- rt ping

# Show unified diff format
jfvm compare 2.74.0 2.73.0 -- config show --unified

# Disable colored output and timing
jfvm compare old new -- rt search "*.jar" --no-color --timing=false
```

**Features:**
- Parallel execution for faster results
- Side-by-side and unified diff formats
- Colored output highlighting differences
- Execution timing comparison
- Exit code and error output comparison

#### `jfvm benchmark <versions> -- <command>`
Run performance benchmarks across multiple JFrog CLI versions with detailed statistics.

```bash
# Benchmark across multiple versions
jfvm benchmark 2.74.0,2.73.0,2.72.0 -- --version

# Custom iterations and detailed output
jfvm benchmark prod,dev,latest -- rt ping --iterations 10 --detailed

# Export results as JSON or CSV
jfvm benchmark 2.74.0,2.73.0 -- config show --format json
jfvm benchmark 2.74.0,2.73.0 -- rt search "*.jar" --format csv
```

**Features:**
- Configurable iteration counts
- Statistical analysis (min, max, average, success rate)
- Multiple output formats (table, JSON, CSV)
- Parallel execution across versions
- Detailed execution logs
- Performance ranking and speed comparisons

#### `jfvm history`
Track and analyze version usage patterns with comprehensive statistics.

```bash
# Show recent usage history
jfvm history

# Show detailed statistics
jfvm history --stats

# Filter by specific version
jfvm history --version 2.74.0

# Limit number of entries
jfvm history --limit 20

# Export as JSON
jfvm history --format json

# Clear history (cannot be undone)
jfvm history --clear
```

**Features:**
- Automatic usage tracking through the shim
- Command execution timing
- Most used versions and commands
- Usage trends and timeline analysis
- Configurable history limits

## üìÅ Project-specific Version

Add a `.jfrog-version` file to your repo:
```bash
echo "2.74.0" > .jfrog-version
```
Then run:
```bash
jfvm use
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Shell Integration
Add this to your shell profile (`.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, etc.):
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.jfvm/shim:$PATH"
```
This allows the shimmed `jf` command to delegate to the correct version transparently.

### Debug Mode
Set `JFVM_DEBUG=1` to see detailed shim execution information:
```bash
export JFVM_DEBUG=1
# Will show which version is being executed
jf --version
```

---

## üß™ Advanced Examples

### Comparing Configuration Changes
```bash
# Compare configuration differences between versions
jfvm compare 2.74.0 2.73.0 -- config show --format json

# Check if a specific feature works across versions
jfvm compare old new -- rt search "libs-release-local/*.jar" --limit 5
```

### Performance Analysis
```bash
# Benchmark search performance across versions
jfvm benchmark 2.74.0,2.73.0,2.72.0 -- rt search "*" --limit 100 --iterations 3

# Test upload performance
jfvm benchmark prod,dev -- rt upload test.txt my-repo/ --iterations 5 --detailed
```

### Usage Analytics
```bash
# See your most used JFrog CLI commands
jfvm history --stats

# Track version adoption over time
jfvm history --version 2.74.0
```

### Automation and CI/CD
```bash
# Export benchmark results for CI analysis
jfvm benchmark $OLD_VERSION,$NEW_VERSION -- rt ping --format json > performance.json

# Compare outputs in automated testing
jfvm compare baseline canary -- rt search "*.jar" --unified --no-color
```

---

## üßº Uninstall
```bash
rm -rf ~/.jfvm
 # if installed via Homebrew
brew uninstall jfvm
```

---
